# Vivanti Demo Walkthrough Script

## Opening

"The best way to show we're AI ready is to tell the story of experience. But how do you tell a story when you scroll? That's the foundation of this idea—scrollytelling."

## Section 1: The Foundation
*[Chip appears in center, lines begin emerging]*

"It starts with AI. The foundation. A single point that begins to reach out."

---

## Section 2: The Chaos
*[Lines spread everywhere wildly]*

"Then it spreads. Everywhere. Healthcare, finance, operations. Scattered. Disconnected. Chaos."

---

## Section 3: The Organization
*[Grids fly in from corners and organize the chaos]*

"Until it's organized. By people who understand patterns. Who can structure chaos into systems."

---

## Section 4: The Intelligence
*[Bot card appears with agent face]*

"We bring the intelligence. People who don't just use AI—but shape it with experience and context."

---

## Section 5: The Understanding
*[Scanner slowly moves down buildings]*

"We scan deeper. Understanding clients layer by layer. Seeing what others miss."

---

## Section 6: The Build
*[Reports and dashboards appear with data]*

"Then we build. Data. Insights. Solutions. Built by people who fundamentally get AI."

---

## Section 7: Vivanti
*[Logo appears]*

"That's Vivanti."
